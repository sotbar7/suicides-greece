# suicides-greece

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The scope of this project is to use the data concerning suicides in Greece and the EU, to study whether there is an increasing trend of suicides in Greece, or better whether the behaviour of Greece is different than the rest of Europe. The output should be a report with at least 10 visualisations to study the data and create an informed opinion about the topic in a concrete and convincing manner.

The key findings of the project are:

* Greece has lower suicides than the EU as a whole.
* Countries in the Mediterranean have fewer suicides, while Nothern Europe has higher suicide rates.
* Men are significantly more likely to commit suicide compared to women.
* The over-representation of men is universal across all countries in the EU.
* The likelihood of suicide increases with age.
* While not true for the whole EU, in Greece the economic slowdown might relate to an increase in suicides.

## DATASET INFORMATION

There are 2 datasets available: the first from Eurostat with absolute numbers for the period 2011-2015 and one from OECD for a longer period but with some missing values. We also used an accompanying dataset from Kaggle, which includes data for all countries of OECD between 1985 and 2016.
